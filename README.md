Sound Localisation & Recognition
======
This is built on top of [ODAS](https://github.com/introlab/odas). Basically this side is just odas but being used to make it easier to deploy configs and changes onto my raspberry pi. More details can be found about the other components [here](https://github.com/sekwah41/SoundLocalisationAndRecognition) (will make this visible once the project has been submitted).

=======

ODAS stands for Open embeddeD Audition System. This is a library dedicated to perform sound source localization, tracking, separation and post-filtering. ODAS is coded entirely in C, for more portability, and is optimized to run easily on low-cost embedded hardware. ODAS is free and open source.

The [ODAS wiki](https://github.com/introlab/odas/wiki) describes how to build and run the software.
